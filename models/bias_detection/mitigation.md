# Stock Price Prediction Model: Bias Detection and Mitigation Documentation

## Overview
This document details our approach to detecting and mitigating bias in our stock price prediction models. We implement a comprehensive bias detection and mitigation pipeline to ensure fair predictions across different market conditions and stock characteristics.

## 1. Bias Detection Methodology

### 1.1 Slicing Techniques
We analyze model performance across multiple data slices:

- **Price-based Slices**
  - Quartile-based segmentation (Q1-Q4)
  - Helps identify bias in different price ranges
  - Metrics tracked: MSE, MAE, R²

- **Volatility-based Slices**
  - Categories: Low, Medium-Low, Medium-High, High
  - Critical for understanding model behavior in different volatility regimes
  - Helps detect stability issues

- **Volume-based Slices**
  - Trading volume quartiles
  - Important for liquidity-based bias detection
  - Ensures model works well in different trading conditions

- **Market Trend Slices**
  - Bull market vs Bear market segments
  - Based on price return patterns
  - Validates model performance in different market conditions

### 1.2 Metrics Tracking
For each slice, we monitor:

python
{
'mse': mean_squared_error,
'mae': mean_absolute_error,
'r2': r2_score,
'size': sample_size
}



## 2. Bias Detection Results

### 2.1 Performance Disparities
We flag bias when:
- Relative difference in MSE > 10% from baseline
- Systematic underperformance in specific slices
- Statistically significant performance variations

### 2.2 Common Bias Patterns
1. Volatility-based bias
   - Higher errors in high-volatility periods
   - Potential underfitting in extreme market conditions

2. Volume-based bias
   - Performance variations in low-volume periods
   - Liquidity-related prediction challenges

3. Price-range bias
   - Different accuracy levels across price ranges
   - Potential scaling issues

## 3. Bias Mitigation Strategies

### 3.1 Reweighting Approach

python
Sample weights calculation
weights = pd.Series(1.0, index=X.index)
for bias_info in biased_slices:
slice_indices = slices[bias_info['slice']].index
weights[slice_indices] = (1 + bias_info['relative_difference'])


### 3.2 Resampling Technique
- Balanced sampling across slices
- Emphasis on underrepresented conditions
- Preservation of temporal patterns

### 3.3 Model Retraining
When bias is detected:
1. Apply weights to training data
2. Retrain model with balanced data
3. Validate improvements across all slices

## 4. Trade-offs and Considerations

### 4.1 Performance vs. Fairness
- **Trade-off**: Overall accuracy vs. balanced performance
- **Solution**: Accept slight decrease in overall metrics for better slice-wise balance
- **Monitoring**: Track both aggregate and slice-specific metrics

### 4.2 Complexity vs. Interpretability
- **Trade-off**: Sophisticated bias mitigation vs. model interpretability
- **Solution**: Two-stage approach with basic and advanced mitigation
- **Documentation**: Clear logging of mitigation steps

### 4.3 Data Efficiency vs. Bias Mitigation
- **Trade-off**: Data utilization vs. balanced representation
- **Solution**: Dynamic reweighting instead of hard filtering
- **Impact**: Minimal data loss while addressing bias
