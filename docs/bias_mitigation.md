# Stock Prediction Pipeline: Bias Mitigation Documentation

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the bias detection and mitigation strategies implemented in our stock prediction pipeline. The process aims to ensure fair and balanced predictions across different market conditions.

## 2. Types of Bias Detected

### 2.1 Market Condition Bias
- **Volatility Bias**: Model performance varies significantly between high and low volatility periods
- **Volume Bias**: Predictions show systematic differences between high and low trading volume periods
- **Trend Bias**: Different performance characteristics in bullish vs bearish markets

### 2.2 Data Distribution Bias
- Imbalanced representation of market conditions
- Over-representation of certain volatility regimes
- Uneven distribution of trading volume scenarios

## 3. Mitigation Strategies

### 3.1 Data Balancing 
```python
def balance_slices(self, df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
# Balance volatility-based samples
high_vol = df[df['volatility'] > df['volatility'].median()]
low_vol = df[df['volatility'] <= df['volatility'].median()]
min_vol_samples = min(len(high_vol), len(low_vol))
# Balance volume-based samples
high_volume = df[df['volume_ma'] > df['volume_ma'].median()]
low_volume = df[df['volume_ma'] <= df['volume_ma'].median()]
min_volume_samples = min(len(high_volume), len(low_volume))
```

### 3.2 Feature Importance Weighting
```python
weighted_features = {
    'price_related': 1.5,    # Higher weight for price indicators
    'volume_related': 1.2,   # Medium weight for volume
    'other_features': 1.0    # Base weight for other features
}
```

### 3.3 Adaptive Prediction Thresholds
```python
# High volatility periods: More conservative
threshold_high_vol = 0.6

# Normal volatility periods: Standard
threshold_normal = 0.5
```

## 4. Implementation Details

### 4.1 Process Flow
1. Data Slice Analysis
2. Bias Detection
3. Mitigation Application
4. Performance Validation

### 4.2 Key Components
```python
class BiasMitigation:
    def mitigate_bias(self, df: pd.DataFrame, slice_metrics: Dict):
        # 1. Balance data slices
        df = self._balance_slices(df)
        
        # 2. Adjust feature weights
        df = self._adjust_feature_weights(df)
        
        # 3. Apply adaptive thresholds
        df = self._adjust_prediction_thresholds(df)
```

## 5. Trade-offs and Considerations

### 5.1 Performance Impact
- **Positive**:
  - More balanced predictions across market conditions
  - Reduced systematic errors
  - Better handling of extreme market conditions

- **Challenges**:
  - Slightly reduced sample size due to balancing
  - Potentially increased computational overhead
  - More complex model maintenance

### 5.2 Monitoring Requirements
- Regular validation of bias metrics
- Performance tracking across different market conditions
- Periodic adjustment of thresholds and weights

## 6. Future Improvements

### 6.1 Planned Enhancements
- Implementation of more sophisticated balancing techniques
- Dynamic threshold adjustment based on market conditions
- Enhanced feature importance calculation

### 6.2 Monitoring Recommendations
- Track bias metrics over time
- Regular validation of mitigation effectiveness
- Periodic review of threshold values

## 7. Data Storage
```
/opt/airflow/data/
├── raw/              # Original stock data
├── processed/        # Cleaned and preprocessed data
└── mitigated/       # Bias-mitigated data
```

## 8. Usage Instructions

### 8.1 Running Bias Mitigation
```python
# Initialize mitigator
mitigator = BiasMitigation(logger=logger)

# Apply mitigation
mitigated_df = mitigator.mitigate_bias(df, slice_metrics)
```

### 8.2 Configuration
- Adjust thresholds in `config/bias_mitigation.yaml`
- Modify feature weights in configuration
- Set balancing parameters as needed

## 9. Validation and Testing
- Unit tests for each mitigation component
- Integration tests for full pipeline
- Performance metrics comparison pre/post mitigation
