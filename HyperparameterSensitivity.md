# Hyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis for Stock Price Prediction

## Overview
This document details the hyperparameter sensitivity analysis conducted on Random Forest and XGBoost models for predicting stock prices of AAPL, GOOGL, and MSFT. The analysis helps understand how different hyperparameters affect model performance and identifies optimal configurations.

## Model Performance Summary
Both models achieved excellent performance with R² scores > 0.9998, with XGBoost consistently outperforming Random Forest across all stocks.

## Random Forest Analysis

### Key Hyperparameters and Their Impact

1. **Number of Estimators (n_estimators)**
   - Range tested: 100-500
   - Optimal value: 500
   - Impact: Higher values consistently improved performance
   - Insight: Complex patterns in stock data benefit from larger ensemble sizes

2. **Maximum Depth (max_depth)**
   - Range tested: 3-8, None
   - Optimal values:
     - AAPL & GOOGL: 10
     - MSFT: None (unlimited)
   - Impact: Deeper trees captured more complex patterns
   - Insight: Stock price patterns require deep tree structures

3. **Minimum Samples Split (min_samples_split)**
   - Range tested: 2, 5, 10
   - Optimal value: 2
   - Impact: Lower values preferred
   - Insight: Finer splits improve prediction accuracy

     - AAPL & MSFT: 300
     - GOOGL: 500
   - Impact: Moderate to high number of trees optimal
   - Insight: Balance between model complexity and performance

2. **Learning Rate**
   - Range tested: 0.01-0.2
   - Optimal values:
     - AAPL & MSFT: 0.05
     - GOOGL: 0.15
   - Impact: Moderate learning rates preferred
   - Insight: Balance between learning speed and stability

3. **Maximum Depth**
   - Range tested: 3-8
   - Optimal values:
     - AAPL & MSFT: 8
     - GOOGL: 4
   - Impact: Stock-specific optimal depths
   - Insight: Different stocks require different tree complexities

4. **Other Parameters**
   - subsample: 0.8
   - colsample_bytree: 0.8
   - min_child_weight: 3
   - Impact: Consistent values across stocks
   - Insight: Good regularization balance

## Key Findings

1. **Model Stability**
   - Both models show high stability across different stocks
   - Consistent performance patterns observed

2. **Performance Hierarchy**
   - XGBoost consistently outperforms Random Forest
   - Both models achieve very high accuracy (R² > 0.9998)

3. **Stock-Specific Patterns**
   - Different stocks require different optimal parameters
   - Suggests unique underlying patterns in each stock

4. **Ensemble Size Impact**
   - Larger ensemble sizes generally beneficial
   - Diminishing returns observed after certain thresholds

## Recommendations

1. **Model Selection**
   - Prefer XGBoost for stock price prediction
   - Consider computational resources vs. marginal performance gains

2. **Hyperparameter Guidelines**
   - Use larger ensemble sizes (300-500 trees)
   - Allow sufficient tree depth
   - Maintain moderate learning rates for XGBoost
   - Keep regularization parameters (subsample, colsample) around 0.8

3. **Stock-Specific Tuning**
   - Consider individual tuning for each stock
   - Monitor performance differences across stocks

## Future Considerations

1. **Extended Parameter Ranges**
   - Test wider ranges for key parameters
   - Investigate interaction effects

2. **Computational Efficiency**
   - Balance performance gains with computational costs
   - Consider parallel processing for larger parameter searches

3. **Dynamic Adaptation**
   - Investigate temporal stability of optimal parameters
   - Consider adaptive parameter adjustment strategies
